### Style Randomization Image Data Augmentation Algorithm

**Brief Description:**  
Developed a novel image data augmentation algorithm based on style transfer techniques, designed to enhance the robustness and adaptability of convolutional neural networks in complex environments.

**Time Period:**  
January 2023 - April 2023

**Tools:**  
Python, PyTorch, VGGNet, Gram Matrices, Gradient Descent

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented a style randomization algorithm that adjusts image style (color and texture) while preserving the original shape and semantic content, using pre-trained VGGNet layers.
- Evaluated the algorithm's effectiveness across multiple computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection, demonstrating improved model accuracy and robustness against domain shift and overfitting.
- Conducted experiments to determine the optimal style transfer parameters, resulting in a 10% accuracy improvement when combined with traditional data augmentation techniques.
